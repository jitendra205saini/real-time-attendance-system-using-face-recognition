# Face Detection and Dataset Collection

This Python script captures images from your webcam and saves cropped face images into a designated folder. It's ideal for creating a dataset for face recognition or training purposes.

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python` and `opencv-contrib-python` packages)
- Numpy

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy

# Face Recognition Model Training

This script is designed to train a face recognition model using the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm. It reads face images from specified folders, assigns labels, and trains a face recognition model, which can later be used for detecting and recognizing faces.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the script:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python` and `opencv-contrib-python` for the face module)
- NumPy

To install the necessary packages, run:

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy
